		<h2>Discovery</h2>
		<h3>Site Intent</h3>
		<h4>Project Overview</h4>
			<p>Spring Lake Elementary school’s website
requires a complete re-design.  For the purposes of this project I will be focusing on 3
main page types; Home page, Sub-content Page, and Form Page previewed on 6 pages total;
Home, About Us, Admissions, Policy and Requirements, Guidance, Contact Us.  My objective
is to create a clean and well-organized site for prospective parents, current parents, and
teachers.</p>

		<h4>Validation Errors</h4>
			<p>When validating on the W3C HTML Validation Service, this site pulled 50
Errors, and 65 Warnings.  They are currently using a Doctype of XHTML 1.0 Traditional,
which is outdated and no longer valid.  They are using internal CSS styling, inline styles
and tables. When validating on the W3C CSS Validation Service, this site pulled 70 Errors,
and 161 Warnings. They have missed semi-colons on numerous lines, using invalid ID
selectors.  My goal is to have a completely validated site using HTML5 and CSS3, creating
a clean html file that can be easily updated by the school administration.</p>

		<h4>Design and layout of content</h4>
			<p>Spring Lake Elementary is not easy to navigate, the main
navigation needs to be consolidated into fewer links.  The content pages need to be placed
in an organized structure that will make it easier for the customer to view and navigate
through.  Pages are not all similar in layout making it confusing to know if you are still
on the school website or have navigated to a new site.  I will also create a fluid design
that will be easy to view and load on a mobile device for those that need information on
the go.</p>

		<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
		<h4>Analytics Overview</h4>
			<p>The Spring Lake Elementary school does not have a singled out ranking on Alexa.com since it is linked off of the Seminole County Public Schools (SCPS) website which is linked off of the main domain k12.fl.us.  It was a bit difficult to narrow down the numbers.  The main site k12.fl.us has a Global Alexa traffic rank of 7,427, and a US rank of 1,601. They have 20% of visits from search engines, with an estimated time of 4 minutes per visit for the past month.  The SCPS comes up at 0.51% of Search Traffic from the queries search traffic off the main k12.fl.us website. </p>
		<h4>Keywords Overview</h4>
			<p>No keywords are currently being used on this site.
When typing in Spring Lake Elementary School, Florida in Google this school is listed as the first 4 choices.</p>
		<h4>Competitor Comparison</h4>
			<p>Orange County Public Schools (OCPS.net), the neighboring county of SCPS has a Global Alexa traffic rank of 42, 687, and a US rank of 9,032.  They currently hold 15% of the visits from search engines and an estimated time of 7 minutes per visit for the past month.  They also do not use keywords on their website, but have a lower rank.
Altamonte Christian School is a private school located in the same town as Spring Lake Elementary with a Global Alexa traffic rank of 10, 975, 157, with no US rank.  No further data is available for review.
Lawton Chiles Prep School for the Gifted and Talented Students, another private school, located in the same county has no data at all available for review or comparison.</p>
		<h4>Summary</h4>
			<p>I highly recommend that each school in Seminole County gain a sub-domain name as each school’s name to separate from the main hub.  I also recommend that a Google Analytics account be created and monitored for the following year after re-design and appropriate changes made to reflect new data.  </p>
