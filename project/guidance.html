            <p><a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('q1')">1. How do I know what middle school my child will attend</a>?</p>
            <div id="q1" style="display:none;">We coordinate with the middle schools during the transition from fifth to sixth grades. Our students are zoned for three different middle schools (Rock Lake, Teague or Milwee) depending upon the home address. Students may also attend magnet schools through an application process. Please contact the Guidance Department for more information on the Magnet Programs or middle schools. To find out what school your address is zoned for please visit http://www.scps.k12.fl.us/ and type in your address under school zone search. If you have any questions about your middle school zoning please contact the Choices department http://www.scps.k12.fl.us/choices/index.cfm or call them at 407-320-0329.

			<p><a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('q3')">3. What is a school counselor?</a></p>
      <div id="q3" style="display:none;">"Today's school counselors are vital members of the education team. They help all students in the areas of academic achievement, personal/social development and career development, ensuring today's students become the productive, well-adjusted adults of tomorrow" (ASCA, 2007).</div>
           
			<p><a style="cursor:pointer;" onclick="return toggleMe('q4')">4. Why school counselors at the elementary level?</a></p>
      <div id="q4" style="display:none;">“The elementary years are a time when students begin to develop their academic self-concept and their feelings of competence and confidence as learners. They are beginning to develop decision-making, communication and life skills, as well as character values. It is also a time when students develop and acquire attitudes toward school self, peers, social groups and family. Comprehensive developmental school counseling programs provide education, prevention and intervention services, which are integrated into all aspects of children’s lives. Early identification and intervention of children’s academic and personal/social needs is essential in removing barriers to learning and in promoting academic achievement. The knowledge, attitudes and skills that students acquire in the areas of academic, career and personal/social development during these elementary years serve as the foundation for future success” (ASCA, 2007).</div>
